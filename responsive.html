    <title>Vitals Responsive</title>

    <!--
    ***
    As you can see, I took advantage of Bootstrap for the responsiveness and the nav bar widget for this exercise.
    I am capable of writing my own responsive CSS but given the short deadline for this test, I did not have
    time to devote to writing my own.
    I also believe that frameworks like Bootstrap are a great tool for consistency in code as well as look and feel,
    and for efficiency of development. It's not always the best decision to write your own when frameworks already exist.
